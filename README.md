## Brief Overview
Police pursuits are one of the most dangerous calls for everyone, including officers, civilians and even the suspect. So in order to grant safety to all citizens of our county i’m setting available to all of our officers and communities a system that can reduce the dangers involved in such calls. I present to you “Star Pursuit”, a GPS Tracker that is deployed from police vehicles to a fleeing vehicle, this GPS tracker updates the officer of the vehicle’s every move. This plugin is based off of a real life gadget that’s being recently deployed in some local agencies around the US called “[StarChase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZI8PheoHA)”
